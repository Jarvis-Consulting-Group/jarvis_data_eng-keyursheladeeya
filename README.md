# Keyurkumar Sheladeeya . Jarvis Consulting

I hold an Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering Technology - Artificial Intelligence from Centennial College, along with a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Engineering from Gujarat Technological University. Currently employed as a Software Developer at Jarvis Technologies Group Inc., I apply my skills to create efficient and effective software systems. Throughout my Advanced Diploma program, I worked on various challenging AI projects, enabling me to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies. Collaborating in a team environment is something I thrive on, and I am interested in both data engineering and developer positions. To further expand my skill set, I am actively enhancing my proficiency in Java while already proficient in Python Framework called Django. Being part of a successful software development team excites me, and I look forward to the challenges and rewards that come with it.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-keyursheladeeya](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-keyursheladeeya)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-keyursheladeeya/tree/master/linux_sql)]: I created a Cluster Monitor Agent utilizing bash scripts, which enables users to monitor and save hardware specifications and usage data for multiple Linux systems. Once installed on each node, the monitoring agent automatically gathers hardware information and resource usage data from the server, storing it in a PostgreSQL database provisioned with Docker. Resource usage is obtained periodically using Crontab every minute, and the collected data can be manipulated through SQL queries. To ensure efficient code review and collaboration among team members, I implemented Git for version control and utilized GitHub as the central repository for the project, enabling effective code review and collaboration among team members.

**Core Java App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-keyursheladeeya/tree/master/core_java)]: JDBC App: In this project, utilized Data Access Object and Repository patterns and the Core Java JDBC API with Maven-managed dependencies to perform CRUD operations on an existing dataset within a PostgreSQL database deployed on a Docker container, while testing the application using SLF4J logger and accessing the database from a terminal.


## Highlighted Projects
**Bicycle Theft Prediction with Supervised Learning**: Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data modeling for classification by implementing a fine-tuned model using Python's Data Pipelines. Subsequently, I utilized Postman to predict the likelihood of a bicycle being stolen by deploying the trained model and providing new data for prediction.

**Student Success Prediction with Neural Network**: Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging real student data to predict their success level. Afterwards, I saved and integrated the trained model into a web application using Flask. For the front-end, I utilized Vue.js to create an interactive user interface.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2023-present)**: I am a member of a collaborative team at Jarvis Technologies, where we work together to design, develop, and implement software systems. My expertise in Python and Java allows me to write high-quality, efficient, and scalable code. I use the tools like Docker, Linux/Bash, Git, and GitHub to manage the software development process and ensure the reliability of the code. My main focus is on delivering software features that meet the requirements, and I always stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices. I actively participate in Agile development processes, following the Scrum methodology to meet project deadlines and deliver high-quality software solutions.

**Junior Backend Developer, Techy Panther (2019-2020)**: I successfully managed the backend infrastructure of a wedding application project, taking charge of API development using the Django framework and leveraging PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and management. Collaborating closely with senior developers and actively engaging with clients, I excelled in gathering requirements and implementing effective error handling strategies to ensure seamless project execution.
