Resource usage is obtained periodically using Crontab every minute, and the collected data can be manipulated through SQL queries. To ensure efficient code review and collaboration among team members, I implemented Git for version control and utilized GitHub as the central repository for the project, enabling effective code review and collaboration among team members.",
