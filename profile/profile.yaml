# List of Jarvis projects

  - name: "Cluster Monitor"

    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: I created a Cluster Monitor Agent utilizing bash scripts, which enables users to monitor and save hardware specifications and usage data for multiple Linux systems. Once installed on each node, the monitoring agent automatically gathers hardware information and resource usage data from the server, storing it in a PostgreSQL database provisioned with Docker. Resource usage is obtained periodically using Crontab every minute, and the collected data can be manipulated through SQL queries. To ensure efficient code review and collaboration among team members, I implemented Git for version control and utilized GitHub as the central repository for the project, enabling effective code review and collaboration among team members.

  - name: "Bicycle Theft Prediction with Supervised Learning"
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: I performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data modeling for classification by implementing a fine-tuned model using Python's Data Pipelines. Subsequently, I utilized Postman to predict the likelihood of a bicycle being stolen by deploying the trained model and providing new data for prediction.
  - name: "Student Success Prediction with Neural Network"
    description: I developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging real student data to predict their success level. Afterwards, I saved and integrated the trained model into a web application using Flask. For the front-end, I utilized Vue.js to create an interactive user interface.
